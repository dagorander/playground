Now create a plan to make a simple todo list app with this!
Will need to store data files in home directory somewhere
Aside from that, start with simple hashmaps
Or at least find out if there's something simpler or better?
since it seems i might not be able to select on an index with hashmaps. :(

could use structs? See the below

That last one used Hashmaps!
